data_description < The dataset is meticulously organized into three folders: train, test, and validation. Each folder contains subfolders for each image category, namely Pneumonia and Normal. The dataset comprises 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG format) across two categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

The chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged one to five years old from the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of the patients' routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low-quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. To account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.>
